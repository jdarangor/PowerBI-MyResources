Links and some PowerBi Resources

At this time, I see PowerBI desktop (PC Root) with two nodes: Power BI Desktop and Power Query Editor. 
Web side, there is Power BI Service, which is also called as “Power BI Workspace”, “Power BI Web Portal”, and “Power BI Site”.

Microsoft Power BI documentation is here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/
